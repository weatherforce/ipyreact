Create a Custom widget
======================

If you are not satisfied with the current available widgets you have two options to build a custom widget. the first one, is building a widget externally using the provided-cookiecutter The following section will provide a cookbook on how to use the cookiecutter.

.. toctree::
   maxdepth: 2
   cookiecutter


the second option is to fork ipyreacwidget, implement your widget based on Widget base class, make it work and ask for a pull request. Do know however that this option is reserved to generic and universal widgets only.
