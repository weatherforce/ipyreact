# Create a custom widget

If you are not satisfied with the current available widgets you have two options to build a custom widget.
the first one, is building a widget externally using the [provided-cookiecutter](https://gitlab.com/weatherforce-platform/cookiecutter-ipyreact-widget)
The following section will provide a cookbook on how to use the cookiecutter.

## Use the Cookiecutter


## Develop a widget directly into ipyreactwidgets  

This is the second way of doing a widget, that could be complementary to the first one. The only issue with this option is that your widget should be accepted as a relevant widget for everyone to be accepted into the ipyreactwidget repository.
