Overview
--------

ipyreact is a complementary project to ipywidgets aiming to provide visual widgets built using the React framework.
The main goal is to provide UI components using Material UI. Material UI allows its user to create great looking, easy
to use applications implementing UI standards. Our aim is to provide a Material UI implementation for the Jupyter world,
in order to ease the dashboard building process for Jupyter Notebook.
