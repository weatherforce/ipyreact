# Install ipyreactwidgets

It is recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

and then you can directly install ipyreactwidgets from pipy package:

```bash
pip install ipyreactwidgets
```

make sure it is installed:

```bash
pip freeze | grep "ipyreactwidgets"
```

You can now import it and use it into a notebook. More on that subject in [quickstart](quickstart.md)
