# Install ipyreact

It is recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

and then you can directly install ipyreact from pipy package:

```bash
pip install ipyreact
```

make sure it is installed:

```bash
pip freeze | grep "ipyreact"
```

You can now import it and use it into a notebook. More on that subject in [quickstart](quickstart.md)
